# PacMen-Exercise
A simple game that allows you create PacMen that move across the screen at different speeds and bounce off the walls.

To run, open index.html in a web browser.

## Roadmap of future improvements
1. Animate each PacMan so that they turn towards the direction they are travelling in.
2. Add further animation to each PacMan so that they open and close their mounths as they travel around.
